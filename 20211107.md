Today I learned the difference between lamda function and functor in C++

A function object or usually referred to as a functor is a construct that allows an object to be called as if it were an ordinary function.
Lambda offers a simpler way to write a functor. It is a syntactic sugar for an anonymous functor. It reduces the boilerplate that we need to write in a functor.
Both functors and lambdas are often used for writing callback functions. They are very useful when we deal with STL algorithms. For example when we want to transform our data stored in a std::vector.
