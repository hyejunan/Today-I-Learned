Big O examples and exercises

<b>Example 1</b> </br>
Whar is the runtimr of the below code?
```Java
void foo(int[] array) {
  int sum = 0;
  int product = 1;
  for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    product *= array[i];
  }
  System.out.printIn(sum + ", " + product);
 }
 ````
> **O(N)** iterate through the array tvice doesn't matter!

<b>Example 2</b> </br>
Whar is the runtimr of the below code?
```Java
void printPairs(int[] array) {
  for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
      System.out.printIn(array[i] + ", " + array[j]);
     }
   }
}

> **O(N^2)** 

<b>Example 3</b> </br>
Whar is the runtimr of the below code?
```Java
void printUnorderedPairs(int[] array) {
  for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (int j = i+1; j < array.length; j++) {
      System.out.printIn(array[i] + ", " + array[j]);
     }
   }
}

> **O(N^2)** 
> This pattern of for loop is very common. It's important that you know the runtime and that you deeply understand it.    

*Counting the iterations*.  
The number of steps total is: (N-1) + (N-2) + (N-3) + ...+ 2+ 1 = sum of 1 throuth N-1 = N(N-1) / 2.  
*What It Means*.  
Alternatively, we can figure out the runtime by thinking about what the code "means". It iterates through each pair of values for (i, j) where j is bigger than i.   
There are N^2 total pairs. Roughly half of those will have i < j and the remaining half will have i > j. This code goes through roughly N^2/2 pairs so it does O(N^2) work.
