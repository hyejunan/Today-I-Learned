Today I learned Big O

### Big O
Big O time is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms.
- Time Complexity</br>
  This is what the comcempt of asymptotic runtime, or big O time, means. We could describe the data transfer "algorithm" runtime as:
  - Electronic Transfer: O(s)
  - Airplane Transfer: O(1)
  - Big O, Big Theta, and Big Omega
- Space Complexity</br>
  This is not the only thing that matters in an algorithm. We might also care about the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm
  Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we need a two-dimensional array of size n by n, this will require O(n2) space
