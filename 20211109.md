Today I learned PostgreSQL & MongoDB

> “PostgreSQL (also known as “Postgres”) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, macOS, Solaris, Tru64), and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.

MongoDB is an open source database that stores its data in JSON like format (technically it’s stored as BSON data but you will interact with its data in JSON format). MongoDB is classified as a NoSQL database. NoSQL is quickly becoming a popular alternative to traditional Relational Databases (RDBMS). The term NoSQL comes from “Not only SQL” and is intended to mean that it is a type of database system that can store data in non traditional tabular and relational format. This is why MongoDB is considered a NoSQL database. It stores its data using object notation.

When you think of how a traditional relational database system works you have tables and records, primary and foreign keys, and joins between tables when writing queries.

RDBMS term	MongoDB term
Table	Collection
Record	Document
Column	Field
Joins	Embed data or link to another collection
