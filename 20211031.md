Today I made momentum website that has realtime clock, display weather, to-do list.
But there's a lot of things to fix cuz I didn't have much time to do it. It doesn't look perfect.
So I will write down the corrections and fix them one by one.

- [ ] Design & layout
- [ ] Font style
- [ ] Add CSS
- [ ] Add more weather option(air quility?)
- [ ] Add searching
