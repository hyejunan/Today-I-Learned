Today I learned C++ Standard Library, Containers and Iterators

### Standard Library
The libraries that support the C++ language core include a broad variety of types, a framework of containers and algorithms for all user-defined types, and support for resource management and multi-threading. 


### Containers and Iterators
The STL defines the sequential container classes in the form of class templates.  These templates include:

- array - contiguous storage of fixed size
- vector - contiguous storage of variable size
- deque - non-contiguous storage of variable size, double-ended queue
- forward_list - non-contiguous storage of variable size, singly linked list
- list - non-contiguous storage of variable size, doubly linked list
An array, unlike a built-in array knows its size and can be copied and assigned, but is allocated on the stack rather than on free store, so its size cannot be changed.
